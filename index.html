        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Lifeguard üèÑ</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> Serim Jang is a lifeguard, CPR, and AED certified individual. She got her certifications in Summer of 2018 and has been renewing her certifications since then. She started working as a lifeguard in the summer of 2021 and in January 2022, she started working as a swim instructor, teaching little kids to adults at the YMCA. Starting Spring 2022, however, she moved to work at the Bay Club.¬†She is a dedicated lifeguard who is responsible for the patron‚Äôs safety. She helps the swimmers stay safe but also she allows patrons to spend an enjoyable time at the pool. She has a positive and good relationship between her employers and coworkers. They always communicate when something is either wrong or right when we face a problem. In addition, Serim is capable of talking to the patrons whenever something is wrong with the pool or if they are doing something that they are not supposed to do. This is really important in this job because communication is the key to a good relationship with their coworkers and the environment.¬† <br><br>

        Other than being a lifeguard and a swim instructor, Serim is a great swimmer. She was in the variety swim team in high school for three years, and was in a club swim team outside of school. She is a dedicated swimmer and a good swimmer. She has been to many different competitions and was able to win some medals. She is a great teammate to her swim team because she brings food for them when they are hungry. As a senior, she once bought food for the underclassmen because they worked hard in a swim competition and wanted to treat them to something for them.
<br><br>

        She will return to the Bay Club for Thanksgiving break of 2022 and Winter break of 2022-2023. She will work as a lifeguard and a swim instructor to provide service for the community. In addition, whenever she needs to renew her certification, she will register for classes and get rectified.¬†
